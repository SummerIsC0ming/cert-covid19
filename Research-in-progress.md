Short: Prior infection with common-cold corona viruses before coming in contact with the covid-19 corona virus could lead to background immunity.

Say: those who had a common-cold before meeting a covid-19-infected person could be protected

Report Mainz, starting 4:50 - 6:10, infection risks while flying (GERMAN)

Short: A simulation during flight, shows the spread of particles when coughing. Dr. Qingyan Chen from Purdue University who is doing research onto building systems to prevent such, said: flying is a risk, distance is too low. The middle seat should be free or, passengers shall wear an FFP2 mask.
